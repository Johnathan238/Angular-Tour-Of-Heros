# Angular-Tour-Of-Heros

### Description
## The Tour of Heroes application that you build helps a staffing agency manage its stable of heroes. The application has many of the features that you'd expect to find in any data-driven application.

### This tutorial helps you gain confidence that Angular can do whatever you need it to do by showing you how to:

Use Angular directives to show and hide elements and display lists of hero data.
Create Angular components to display hero details and show an array of heroes.
Use one-way data binding for read-only data.
Add editable fields to update a model with two-way data binding.
Bind component methods to user events, like keystrokes and clicks.
Enable users to select a hero from a list and edit that hero in the details view.
Format data with pipes.
Create a shared service to assemble the heroes.
Use routing to navigate among different views and their components.
